# Gap-Detection
Simulation and analysis code for the paper "Mind the gap: decoding decreases in tonic firing in populations of spiking neurons" by Durian et al (2022).

Data simulated using this code is available on GIN (link). (On GIN say: code for simulating and analyzing these data is available on GitHub)
